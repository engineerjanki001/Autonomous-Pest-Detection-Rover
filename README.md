# Autonomous-Pest-Detection-Rover
The Autonomous Pest-Detection Rover is a low-cost robotic system designed to help identify early signs of pest infestation or plant stress in agricultural environments. The rover navigates autonomously, monitors plant conditions, and alerts users when abnormal patterns are detected.
Problem

Pests and plant diseases are often detected too late due to manual inspection, leading to reduced yields and environmental harm.

Solution

Our rover:

Navigates autonomously through plant rows

Avoids obstacles using ultrasonic sensors

Monitors plant health using sensors

(Optional) Uses a camera and ML to detect pests

It provides early alerts so farmers can act quickly.

Tech Stack

Raspberry Pi Pico H – motors, sensors, navigation

Optional Raspberry Pi 3/4 – camera & ML inference

Ultrasonic, soil moisture, temperature sensors
